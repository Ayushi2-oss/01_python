GitHub Actions

It is a CI/CD tool. It is used to automate software development Workflows.
Trigger IN/TO a Repo -> GitHub EVENT(pull request, creating, some issue etc) -> Automate ACTIONS are done as an response

Workflow are written in yaml format. They are reusable. we can write reusable workflows where we write normal workflows that is in GitHub/workflows
There are different "Attributes" associated with different things in the workflow.
Eg -
whenever we are referring to "actions" {attr = uses}
for "commands" like chmod etc {attr = run}
for name {attr : name}
for telling what triggers the action {attr : on}.
